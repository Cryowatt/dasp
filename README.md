# dasp

**Digital Audio Signal Processing in Rust.**

A suite of crates providing the fundamentals for working with PCM (pulse-code
modulation) DSP (digital signal processing). In other words, `dasp` provides a
suite of low-level, high-performance tools including types, traits and functions
for working with digital audio signals.


## Crates

**dasp** is a modular collection of crates, allowing users to select the precise
set of tools required for their project. The following crates are included
within this repository:

| Crate | Badges | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dasp_sample |   |   |
| dasp |   |   |


## Contributing

If the **sample** crate is missing types, conversions or other fundamental
functionality that you wish it had, feel free to open an issue or pull request!
The more hands on deck, the merrier :)
